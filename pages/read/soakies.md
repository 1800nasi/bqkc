# **Remembering "Soakie's": Kansas City's former Black gay bar from the Y2K Era**

Volume_2 of {B/qKC}, rediscovers Soakie's: a former Black gay bar in Kansas City from 1994-2004. 
A refurbished version of the groundbreaking article for {B/qKC}'s database.

<summary>Foreword</summary>

*Welcome to Volume_2 of {B/qKC}. It would be remiss for me to begin this new era without saying thank you. Though I believe it is the inherent duty of any human being to understand the place and time they reside in, I am deeply touched by the many hands contributing to this communal archival project. I thank those who offered space, those who offered capital, those who offered affirmation, those who offered critique, those who offered love, and–above all–those Black queer Kansas Citians who believed so deeply in their liberation that we can, now, continue their work.*

*Since Volume_1's completion earlier this Summer, I have been working intensely and intently on expanding {B/qKC}. The project initially grew from a frustration with the lack of Black queer spaces in Kansas City, and I, thus, saw a need to investigate the history of Black queer people in our city. Volume_1 was focused on "liberating" Black queer photos, documents and ephemera from local institutions that had no plans to widely publish the materials or make them digitally accessible.*

***Volume_2 and all forthcoming installments will be dedicated to building one of the world's only Black queer archives.***

***Volume_2 launches with three collections from our local Black queer eldership, each telling its own story of Soakie's: a Black gay bar that served as the birthplace for many of our local Black queer elders today.***

*There are many goals I hope to accomplish with {B/qKC}, but the project's main tenets are to:*

*1) increase access to our Black, queer Kansas Citian histories,
2) challenge local institutions and the concept of "ownership,"
3) demonstrate precedence for future reparative efforts, and 
4) educate and imagine Black queer futures through community reflection of this historical research.*

*With bigoted legislation and representation that actively seeks to erase our knowledge and indoctrinate future generations, it is more important than ever to document our histories-not just as static stories but as didactic, interactive artifacts that educate, challenge, storytell, pay homage, repair, destroy, and build anew.*

*At its very core, aside from the archive's historical content, I am using {B/qKC} to create new ways to engage with our City's contentious past-in a way that doesn't center worship of written word, paternalism, and objectivity (characteristics of "white supremacy culture" coined by Kenneth Jones and Tema Okun). Instead, I want to challenge us to learn history through conversation and community, working in unconventional spaces, not just the white, sanitized institutional settings we are told to. *

*Considering {B/qKC}'s historical content with the aforementioned objectives, the project grows beyond an archive, it is a tool for abolition: the project is dismantling the ways we traditionally engage with history, while paying homage to Black queer folk-literally, through dollars, and figuratively, through remembrance. And as I want this research to bring in subjectivity and analysis, {B/qKC} also examines what ways we've succeeded and what ways we've failed to keep Black queer folks safe-and what must be done moving forward so that these missteps won't happen again (or, at the very least, are rectified). *

* * * * *

*Volume 2 begins with Soakie's. Outcast from their age's existing spaces, Black queer Kansas Citians found solace in a Downtown Kansas City sandwich shop–converging at night for drinks, music, performances, and community. We learn how white people and capitalism ultimately led to both the creation and downfall of Soakie's, and why there are currently no Black gay bars in Kansas City. *

*This is a lesson in the enduring fight to divest from white capital and how physical space has contributed to Black liberation.*

## Vol_2 of {B/qKC}: Soakie's

<blockquote class="quote-box">

In Kansas City circa July 2002, you could stumble upon one of a whopping 13 gay bars and clubs; 8 of these lived on Main Street–including Sidestreet and Sidekicks, names that some may be familiar with today (see Figure 1).

Lesser-known of that bunch is Soakie's; the once "Famous for Sandwiches" spot operated by Italian mobsters was also one of Kansas City's, and the world's, few Black gay bars from 1994-2004.

Now there are only 8 gay bars in Kansas City, and a good chunk of these are plagued with accusations of racism, transphobia, femmephobia and lesbophobia.

{% include feature/image.html objectid="garycoll024" width="75" %}

According to a 2019 study by Greggor Mattson[^1], a professor of Sociology at Oberlin College, Mattons infers, based on the annual Damron guides, that LGBTQ+ bars have been on a steep decline since the 1980s (see Figure 2). From 2007 to 2019, LGBTQ+ bars as a whole declined by 36.6% while queer bars for people of color declined by nearly 60%.

In short, we are losing our safe spaces.

There has recently been a shift in the neo-liberal sphere where, instead of using the term "safe spaces," they express the need to be fostering "brave spaces." The idea is that brave spaces honor discomfort and, thus, the expensing of emotional labor as a means for growth. While I get the sentiment, this is something that white people need to create for themselves, and *in addition* to the spaces Black queer people need exclusively for themselves. 

When night rolls around and people retire to friends and cocktails at their favorite places, where can Black queer Kansas Citians go and truly feel celebrated and safe?

The answer is nowhere–at least, not above ground.

And this is why it is so important to share the story of Soakie's: a public beacon of kinship for Black queer Kansas Citians and the gay awakening for much of our Black queer eldership today.

Founded by Italian mobster Salvatore A. "Soakie" Rinaldo in 1962, Soakie's initially started out as a local neighborhood dive bar at 1308 Main Street–roughly, where Yard House is located today[^4]. Though Rinaldo was notorious in Kansas City as part of the mob, not much else is known about his personal or family life due to general fear around mob culture.

Soakie's functioned primarily as a packaged liquor and sandwich shop, recognizable by its sign's slogan "Famous For Sandwiches;" the bar also cashed checks for those who didn't have bank accounts or didn't want the hassle of making an extra trip to the bank[^5]. According to an [early 2000's internet chat room](https://kcrag.com/viewtopic.php?t=10070&start=60), the sandwiches were delectable, and many downtown workers frequented there during their lunch time[^6].

The space was small, and functioned as a dive bar–it had no more than a few high top tables, a jukebox, a pool table, and a small upstairs area that would eventually turn into a dance floor that could house 50 people. It was housed right next to a parking garage and across from a parking lot.

But that didn't stop the bar from becoming a popular hangout spot for Black queer Kansas Citians. Because of the jukebox and its proximity to another gay hotspot, Connections (now known to many as Sidekicks), many Black queer locals would go to Soakie's to pregame.

Soakie's: The Black Gay Bar
--------------------------

<div class="float-img float-right">
  {% include feature/image.html objectid="tishacoll006" width="75" %}
</div>

Before local Black queers found community at Soakie's in 1994, people had to make do with white gay clubs that weren't receptive or welcoming to Black folks.

White gay clubs are historically accused of having racial quotas and requiring multiple forms of identification from Black people to limit their numbers within the establishment; the famed Dixie Belle Bar (another gay bar in Kansas City) was one of these. Located on 1922-1924 Main Street, the bar would come under fire for its racist practices, including the display of a Confederate Flag-[prompting a local, interracial gay organizing group to condemn their actions](https://kansascitydefender.com/lgbtqia2/men-of-all-colors-together/)[^7].

<div class="clearfix"></div>

<div class="float-img float-left">
  {% include feature/image.html objectid="tishacoll005" width="100" %}
</div>
Jerry Colston, a prominent figure in Soakie's rebirth as a nightclub, recounts his experience there in the 1990s:

<blockquote class="quote-line">
  <p class="quote-text">"A couple people used to tell me, 'Why you go down there, don't you know that they don't care about you?' Where else am I gonna go? Your house? I mean, you know, where else am I supposed to go? We don't have nowhere to go."</p>
</blockquote>

It was this same sentiment that would lead Colston and his good friend Eric Robinson to pitch a new idea to Salvatore A. Rinaldo to transform his sandwich bar into a nightclub. [^8]

<div class="clearfix"></div>

### That Fateful Meeting

According to Colston and Robinson, Rinaldo was getting ready to close his shop around the same time Soakie's was becoming a pregame spot for Black queer people in the '90s. The three of them had established a friendly rapport in light of this. In fact, Robinson notes that Rinaldo treated him and the community with kindness and was extremely supportive.

<blockquote class="quote-box">
  <p class="quote-text">“We don't have nowhere to go.”</p>
  <p class="quote-attrib">— Jerry Colston, 2023</p>
</blockquote>

<div class="clearfix"></div>

<div class="float-img float-left">
  {% include feature/image.html objectid="garycoll013" width="100" %}
</div>

Over the course of a few months, as Rinaldo spoke of hardship with the bar, Colston and Robinson pitched various ideas that eventually led them to propose a full business plan-Soakie's could turn into a nightclub on weekends.

Rinaldo approved, but would not invest in the concept. So, Colston and Robinson began funding the club's necessities from scratch–adding things like a DJ booth (and the equipment needed for it) and stretching the club's tight space by using a curtain that extended to the entrance of the next-door parking garage. They'd also paint the front of Soakie's in its signature white and blue colors.

From there, the duo marketed the new club through word-of-mouth and by hustling flyers. They already had their names out in the community, which helped draw in big crowds.

The first night of the club's opening, there was a line wrapped around the block.

### Views of Soakie's Interior

**A birthplace for Black queer identity**
-----------------------------------------

{% include feature/image.html objectid="garycoll003;garycoll001" %}

From then on, the Black gay nightclub would open Friday, Saturday and Sunday. Though primarily a club, where Soakie's truly shined were in its performers.

Because Soakie's was so intensely tied to Kansas City's underground ballroom scene, it became host to a multitude of entertainers and different events: competitions, pageants, birthdays and more. This also meant more people became involved with managing the bar and its events–namely Tisha Taylor and Gary Carrington, a local Black drag queen and performer/emcee, respectively, and both legends in their own right.

One of Soakie's most noteworthy events, covered in several editions of KC Exposures, a former, local LGBTQIA2S+ weekly publication of the period, was "Mr. and Miss Soakies." The event was a summer pageant competition to crown the eponymous king and queen of the bar. The competition was based on evening wear, talent and an interview–similar to a beauty competition. Winners would receive a trophy, plaque, sash, flowers and a cash prize.

<div class="float-img float-right">
  {% include feature/image.html objectid="garycoll027" width="100" %}
</div>

Other noteworthy competitions included:
- The Lords & Ladies Pageant: a pageant for Black masc ('Lords') and femme ('Ladies') lesbians
- Mr. & Miss Black Gay Pride: a pageant coinciding with Kansas City's annual Black Pride in August

When the bar began declining around the early 00s, Tisha Taylor created "Taylor Time": a raffling event on Sundays where folks could buy a drink and enter into a drawing for a multitude of prizes–one time even including a car.[^9]Tisha notes that it drew in straight crowds and critical funding for the bar. And as a rule instituted by Tisha, folks would have to exclaim "Right here, honey!" to claim their prize if their number was called.

Although Soakie's was brimming with Black queer joy, members note that the bar wasn't free of controversy. Gary Carrington chronicles how Soakie's value as a safe space was threatened:

<blockquote class="quote-line">
  <p class="quote-text">"We got a lot of pushback when we first started growing. We got a lot of 'spies' who would pop-up and come in. They'd order a drink, not finish it, and then leave."</p>
</blockquote>

A lot of vitriol also came as a result of John Koop, known by their drag name Flo, who was the creator of [Show Me Pride, LLC](https://queerkc.wordpress.com/category/big-gay-scandals/)–a business that began running Kansas City's annual Pride in 2003, shifting the parade from a protest to a capitalist spectacle. Flo was expressly named as a racist by a multitude of Black LGBTQIA2S+ Kansas Citians during my research; she would commonly discourage people from attending Soakie's by using the bar as a punchline during her shows at Missie B's. 

<div class="clearfix"></div>

The Soakie's staff, however, was extremely protective of attendees at the bar–Starla Carr, a founder of Kansas City's drag king circuit in the 2000s, mentions how, although it has become a running joke now, a baseball bat was kept underneath the bar at all times. Starla also recognized that aside from being a patron and performer, she was also a gatekeeper.

Famously referenced by local Black queers, one of the most critical components of Soakie's existed outside the bar.

Across 1308 Main Street was a large parking lot that became a hangout spot for Black queer people. Audiences in the lot differed: Korea Kelly (a local legend), Starla Carr and DJ Baby Boi speak about it being an entrypoint into learning more about their identities, as they were all too young to enter the bar at the time. It was a spot for after hours hangouts and people who couldn't afford cover charges. People even walked pageants and competitions in the lot. To an extent, it became a destination as much as Soakie's itself.

This would become an issue, though, as it drew away from the capital Soakie's owners were receiving, and was also the source of a lot of violence.

<blockquote class="quote-box">
  <p class="quote-text">† There are currently no photos available in the public domain, or as donated to {B/qKC}, that capture festivities in the parking lot across from Soakie's.

</blockquote>

**The People of Soakie's**
--------------------------

In my interviews with a long list of Black queer people who used to attend Soakie's, they unanimously noted that Soakie's was the birthplace of their fully-formed identities–a place where they first embodied their queerness.

Below are a few Black Kansas Citians who were involved with Soakie's in some way–including those who have graciously donated to the inaugural digital collections of *{B/qKC}*.

### **Baby Boi**

{% include feature/video.html objectid="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb2gqIY3oEc" width="75" %}

Known to Kansas Citians today as a popular local DJ, Baby Boi's first encounter with Soakie's was also a pivotal moment in discovering their community.

Baby Boi recounts their teenage years, when they saw Soakie's for the first time:

<blockquote class="quote-line">
  <p class="quote-text">"A couple, you know, friends and I, we went to a haunted house<sup>‡</sup>. And of course, we're looking across the street, and we're like, what's up with that place? Because on the sign, you see 'Famous for Sandwiches' (laughs); but you see certain individuals walk in and they look a little different from so-called "everyday people." I wasn't old enough to really comprehend it.</p>

  <p class="quote-text">When I got a little older, my friends and I would tell our parents we were going out to so-and-so's house, but really we would all sit in the parking lot across from Soakie's and look in awe."</p>
</blockquote>

It wouldn't be that long before Baby Boi became part of the view. Baby Boi would be adopted into Kansas City's Ballroom scene, and perform at Soakie's under the pseudonym "Baby Beauty" of the House of Beauty<sup>§</sup>. Later on, Baby Boi would join the House of Carrington, where their role expanded into hosting shows and segments as well.

To my surprise, Baby Boi's DJing career didn't officially start until 2017–and it seems a perfect continuation from performing for, as Baby Boi puts it, "if [they] can give people a good time or experience, let's do it."

<blockquote class="quote-box">
  <p class="quote-text"><sup>‡</sup>Baby Boi references the late-haunted house, Main Street Morgue: located on 1325 Main Street from the 1970s to the early 00s. The business was shut down as part of the Power & Light Development.</p>

  <p class="quote-text"><sup>§</sup>Descriptions of Kansas City's Ballrooms Scene are purposely meant to be ambiguous as to protect a well kept tradition of Kansas City's Black queer community.</p>
</blockquote>

### **Starla Carr**
*Donor of the "starla_carr_collection" to {B/qKC}*

{% include feature/video.html objectid="starlacoll034" %}

Starla Carr's "[Queer Club Culture in 1990s Kansas City: A Chance Encounter with Soakies](https://www.hiphopdancealmanac.com/ink-cypher-queer-club-culture)," featured in the Hip Hop Dance Almanac, was a foundational piece for me in beginning this research project.

And just as she was foundational for me now, Starla has been a pivotal force in developing Kansas City's drag king circuit over the past 30 years. Known under the performing name "MT" (and performing alongside Baby Boi on numerous occasions), Starla recounts her experience as a performer:

<blockquote class="quote-line">
  <p class="quote-text">"Our male drag group was called the Kings of KC. The connections I made at Soakie's extended farther than just performing at the club, and I started to meet male drag artists all over Kansas City. Our Drag King group practiced routines in my living room preparing for shows, and one of my favorite memories is when we decided to perform a song by the Black Eyed Peas remixed with 'Love Shack' by The B-52's. It was stupid hot that summer, and we were wearing afro wigs for the first part of the performance, switching costumes when the song flipped [...] We transformed ourselves into our favorite rap artists and RnB singers. I still remember using spirit gum and weave clippings to make a fake little mustache for my performance as LL Cool J.</p>

  <p>[...]</p>

  <p class="quote-text">Soakie's had balls, too, much like those of the Harlem Renaissance era, and that's when we'd bring out the best performances. You were guaranteed to find top shelf entertainment, dance routines worked on for months and the newest music. As a member of the entertainers there, my eyes were opened to how society treated us outside the safety of our club, so I became a gatekeeper, making sure the place remained safe and it's a responsibility I don't take lightly."</p>
</blockquote>

Outside of performing at Soakie's herself, Starla helped other entertainers by designing their costumes and choreographing their performances. 

Above all, though, Starla has been an instrumental support system for those around her. Starla recounted stories about marrying one of her male best friends so he could keep his visa and holding space for gender non-conforming individuals who didn't fit within binary systems at Soakie's (and elsewhere).

It is with great honor that I welcome her collection to {B/qKC}.

<blockquote class="quote-box">
  <p class="quote-text">The "starla_carr_collection" is one of the inaugural collections digitized and donated to {B/qKC}. The collection consists of various photos from Carr's time as a seamstress, performer and go-er of Soakies in the early 2000s.</p>

### **Tisha Taylor**

A photo of Tisha Taylor (center) printed in K.C. Exposures as part of Tisha Taylor's Birthday Bash in 2004. On either side are the succeeding owners of Soakie's (who are dually Salvatore's nephew and niece-in-law): Jimmy (left) and Sue (right). (*Photo by Chuck Tackett. "Tisha Taylor's Birthday Bash," KC Exposures. April 29, 2004. Digitized as part of the Gary Carrington Collection of {B/qKC}*).

Tisha Taylor was an instrumental part in managing and ensuring Soakie's success. Originally a "front-door girl," or greeter, for the bar, Taylor's role would expand after Jerry Colston was victim of a stabbing around the first year of Soakie's opening. During his recovery, Taylor managed the bar: developing different events and entertainment and bringing in famous talent–such as porn star Bobby Blake one New Year's Eve.

Taylor reflects on a New Year's Eve 2000 party–one of her favorite memories from Soakie's–below:

<blockquote class="quote-line">
  <p class="quote-text">"Our New Year's Eve parties were eventful. Those, and then my birthday party as well, which were fun. I had birthday parties where I had cakes with fountains and bridges...they looked like wedding cakes. And people would come in and say, 'Who's getting married?' (laughs)</p>

  <p class="quote-text">But there was one New Year's Eve party we were all scared because, you know, we were always told that in the year 2000 the lights were going to go out. The world was gonna end. And we all fed into that. So we all came together and did the countdown that year. And before the end of it, we said, well, you know, we don't know what's going on, but we're glad we're together.</p>

  <p class="quote-text">So, all of us that hung out together, all of us, were in that one spot.</p>
</blockquote>

Outside of Soakie's, Taylor has made a huge impact on the local Black LGBTQ+ scene, winning Miss Gay Kansas City America in 1995 and founding Kansas City's annual Black Pride in 1999.

### **Gary Carrington **
Donor of the "gary_carrington_collection" to {B/qKC}

{% include feature/video.html objectid="garycoll029" %}

Gary Carrington, alongside Tisha Taylor, was instrumental in helping manage the bar. Carrington initially started out as security, checking ID's at the door, but his role expanded during Jerry's recovery. Taylor credits Carrington with creating the Mr. and Miss Soakie's Pageant–and specifically creating a culture that allowed men to compete in pageant competitions similar to their drag queen counterparts. 

Carrington was also one of the first men to entertain in the bar through emceeing Soakie's competitions, though his introduction to the task was accidental. When Tisha Taylor changed costumes, she would task Carrington with entertaining the crowd. But he became enamored with the act:

<blockquote class="quote-line">
  <p class="quote-text">"It's a bar full of people, listening to my every word while I hold the microphone. I loved it."</p>
</blockquote>

Taylor, who still texts Carrington every morning to check on him, had this to say:

<blockquote class="quote-line">
  <p class="quote-text">"Gary was one of the first ones that started entertaining as far as emceeing. I was originally emcee, and then Gary started taking over as emcee.</p>

  <p class="quote-text">And I always, you know, I pat myself on the back for Gary all the time because he was a product of me. (laughs)</p>

  <p class="quote-text">But, Gary is himself. Gary is original. If I were to have something, he would be the first one I would call to emcee that because he's very entertaining. I don't even want to stand up next to him anymore. He puts me to shame. I go back to those days often.</p>
</blockquote>

Similar to Taylor's sentiments, Carrington was not only instrumental in providing the photos and ephemera to make this article possible but a powerful link to other Black LGBTQ+ folks who used to attend Soakie's.

It is with great honor that I welcome his collection to {B/qKC}.

**Closing Shift: Gentrification of Downtown Kansas City**
---------------------------------------------------------

{% include feature/image.html objectid="starlacoll020" width="75" %}

Much of the reason Soakie's no longer exists today was outside the control of its Black audience.

Around 2002, founder Salvatore Rinaldo died under mysterious circumstances–ruled a suicide, officially, by carbon monoxide poisoning. 

After Rinaldo's death, his nephew and niece, Jimmy and Sue, took over the bar, which led to a temporary break in Soakie's as a nightclub. 

Although they were successful in keeping the bar afloat, they faced a new challenge with the downtown Kansas City Power & Light (P&L) development project beginning in 2004–headed by the Cordish Company, an out-of-state, privately-held development organization responsible for the $850 million dollar development project. Cordish Company is responsible for the third- and fourth-wave gentrification that pushed out Black and low-income people to make way for P&L as we know it today[^10]. This is also not the first time Cordish Companies has come under fire from the local queer community, having been met with protests in 2008 when Show Me Pride, LLC (the for-profit organization that commodified pride, created by the aforementioned John Koop) moved the annual Pride parade to P&L [^11]

The protest, according to a local blog, was meant to expose Power & Light’s financial corruption and their hosting of Pride that year as nothing more than rainbow capitalism.

According to several interviewees, the City of Kansas City had initially offered to buy out Soakie's, but Jimmy and Sue refused their offer in hopes they would come back with something larger. To their dismay, however, the City expounded on Jimmy's criminal background and served Jimmy an eviction notice after he was caught serving alcohol–unknowingly to Tisha Taylor[^12].

The night before the bar closed, a Sunday, there was one last large party. Around 9:00am later that day, Jimmy called Taylor and informed her the bar had been shut down, and he had already liquidated most of its belongings–thus, ending the sandwich bar and Black gay safehaven.

**Conclusion**
--------------

The LGBTQ+ community is suffering from a decline in Black gay bars and dedicated spaces for queer people of color. Though a bar may seem insignificant to some, Soakie's demonstrates that the bar was more than just a place to have a drink. It was a nexus point. It was where people began to fully realize their identity. And, towards the end, it became a piece of political and economic organizing power against a development company. 

Next year marks 30 years since Soakie's was founded, and 20 years since it was shut down. I only pray that it does not take decades to build a Black queer sanctuary once again.
