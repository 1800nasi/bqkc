Starla Carr (she/her/hers) has been a pivotal force in developing Kansas City’s drag king circuit over the past 30 years. Known under the performing name “MT,” Starla has been involved in Kansas City’s Black queer scene as a seamstress, choreographer, author and confidant. The starla_carr_collection, an inaugural collection donated to {B/qKC}, consists of various photos from Carr’s time at Soakie’s in the early 2000s–particularly of KC’s Black lesbian community.    </p>
