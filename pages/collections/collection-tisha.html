      Craig Lovingood, more widely known by their drag persona Tisha Taylor (she/her/hers) has made significant impacts on the local Black LGBTQ+ scene. Tisha particularly founded Kansas City’s annual Black Pride in 1999 and won Miss Gay Kansas City America in 1996. She was also instrumental in managing Soakie’s: Kansas City’s former Black gay bar in Downtown Kansas City. The tisha_taylor_collection, an inaugural collection donated to {B/qKC}, consists of various photos from Tisha’s time at Soakie’s and Kansas City’s Black Pride in 1999.
