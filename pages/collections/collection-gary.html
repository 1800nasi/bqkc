Gary Carrington (he/him/his) is referred to as a “pillar” in Kansas City’s queer pageant/event promotions scene. Specifically credited with founding a plethora of local pageant competitions, Gary has served several roles within KC’s Black queer community–including the management of Soakie’s: Kansas City’s former Black gay bar in Downtown Kansas City. The gary_carrington_collection, an inaugural collection donated to {B/qKC}, consists of various photos from Gary’s time at Soakie’s, as well as clippings from KC Exposures.
