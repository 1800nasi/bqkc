# **{B/qKC}** is a *decentralized* archival project challenging out-dated institutional practices within the frame and study of Black queer history.

Under a reinvigorated wave of white nationalism and fascism post-2016, our historical record continues to be warped, distorted, and erased; **we are actively being indoctrinated**. 

Our treasured mementos, amassed by institutional libraries, archives and universities, are effectively being <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/03/07/nx-s1-5321003/pentagon-images-flagged-removal-dei-purge-trump" target="blank">deleted by President Donald J. Trump and his Project 2025 agenda.</a> 

And across the world, the worst manifestations of fascist indoctrination occur in Palestine, <a href="https://librarianswithpalestine.org/gaza-report-2024/" target="blank">where israel has deliberately bombed and destroyed museums, archives, libraries–as a result, destroying many significant historic materials to erase Palestinian existence from our memories</a>.

There is a damning need to be stewards of our own histories and protect them at all costs. The ways we decide to document and collect our histories can no longer be done passively or uncritically. Memory work must be an *active*, radical process.

{B/qKC} was founded as an official community archive on March 1st, 2024, operating on the principles of accessible *storytelling*, *repair* of our historical record, and intergenerational *power building*–all within the frame and study of midwestern Black queer history.

## Core Goals

Initially ideated as a series of research articles "liberating" Black queer materials from its local institutions and libraries, {B/qKC}'s mission has evolved into a full-fledged archive with **five core goals**.

##### 1. **INTERGENERATIONAL CONNECTION AND COMMUNITY BUILDING**
We aim to develop a platform that bridges generational gaps: fostering stronger relationships between Black queer elders and younger generations, digitally and physically. Relationships will always come to us first before labor.

##### 2. **ACCESSIBLE, OPEN-ACCESS ARCHIVING**
We aim to build and maintain an intuitive, open-access digital archive stewarded by the people–always ensuring the archive is an accessible tool and not a product for profiteering.

##### 3. **DIFFUSION OF KNOWLEDGE**
We aim to teach any and all communities about the significance of this archive's materials, and the overall importance of radical memory work.
##### 4. **PRESERVATION OF AT-RISK MATERIALS**
We aim to create digital snapshots of Black queer historical materials, ensuring a record of Black queer midwestern histories can be saved, maintained, and reproduced physically–ensuring long-term sustainability of our stories.
##### 5. **PERMANENT AND DECENTRALIZED PRESENCE**
We aim for Black queer stories to occupy public spaces physically and digitally to ensure permanence of our stories, while simultaneously increasing Black queer visibility.

## Our history

{B/qKC} was initially founded as a research project in 2022 by Nasir Anthony Montalvo shortly after moving to Kansas City. At the time of Montalvo's move, they found little-to-nothing existed digitally about Black queer people in KC, and most local archiving institutions were not "aware" of any significant histories pertaining to this community. Montalvo released a series of articles through a collaboration with the Gay and Lesbian Archives of Mid-America (GLAMA) at the University of Missouri-Kansas City that digitized their small collection of Black queer materials (which previously had no finding aids and no concrete plans on making them publicly accessible). Their research explored KC's first documented Black drag queens of Kansas City, an organization of gay men fighting racism in the community in the 90’s, and a gay and lesbian variety show called “Out There” that aired on public-access cable.

In early 2023, after researching Volume 1 of the project, Montalvo morphed these archival materials into a multi-location, self-service exhibit from February 27th – March 4th, 2023 hosted at different locations across Kansas City–with each location hosting different materials from the volume. This propelled the project to new heights, connecting Montalvo to Kansas City's underground ballroom community. The relationships Montalvo, themself, and their peers formed with these elders began a new era of the project–one that sought to rightfully honor and respect the contributions of KC's Black queer elders.

Since 2022, {B/qKC} has launched at least two public exhibitions per year, and engaged in a variety of innovative, community collaborations per year meant to expose more Kansas Citians to the power of memory work alongside KC's Black queer histories. 

{B/qKC} has been internationally recognized as a powerful example of community archives, and the ways archiving can be used to materially change our futures for the better.
