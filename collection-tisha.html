   Tisha Taylor (she/her/hers) has made a huge impact on the local Black LGBTQ+ scene, particularly founding Kansas City’s annual Black Pride in 1999 and winning Miss Gay Kansas City America in 1996. Tisha was also instrumental in managing Soakie’s: Kansas City’s former Black gay bar in Downtown Kansas City. The Tisha Taylor Collection, an inaugural collection donated to {B/qKC}, consists of various photos from Taylor’s time at Soakie’s and Kansas City’s Black Pride in 1999.
